#from __future__ import print_function

# print statement
print "Hello, world!"
print "Hello, " "world!"
print "Hello,", "world!"
print "Hello, " + "world!"

# built-in function
print ("Hello, world!")
print ("Hello,", "world!")
# that last one is a tuple which is why it doesn't print like the others
# however if you make print a function by enabling the import above
# then it behaves like a print

#this next one also only works with the print function, not the statement
#print ("Hello,", end=" ")
#print ("world!")
