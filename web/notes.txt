AJAX - see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_%28programming%29
Ajax (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) is a group of interrelated web development methods used on the client-side to create asynchronous web applications. With Ajax, web applications can send data to, and retrieve data from, a server asynchronously (in the background) without interfering with the display and behavior of the existing page. Data is usually retrieved using the XMLHttpRequest object. Despite the name, the use of XML is not needed (JSON is often used instead), and the requests do not need to be asynchronous.
Ajax is not a single technology, but a group of technologies. HTML and CSS can be used in combination to mark up and style information. The DOM is accessed with JavaScript to dynamically display, and to allow the user to interact with the information presented. JavaScript and the XMLHttpRequest object provide a method for exchanging data asynchronously between browser and server to avoid full page reloads.

JSON - see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is an alternative to XML for storing data in human-readable format and uses JavaScript syntax for describing the objects. JSON is still language and platform independent, and JSON parsers and JSON libraries exists for many different programming languages.
Why JSON? For AJAX applications, JSON is faster and easier than XML, because...
Using XML:
- Fetch an XML document
- Use the XML DOM to loop through the document
- Extract values and store in variables
Using JSON:
- Fetch a JSON string
- eval() the JSON string
